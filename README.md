# Recursion Practice

This repo covers two challenges from the Odin Project practicing recursion.

## Fibonacci Sequence

This file covers two implementations of a method to return the first _n_ elements in the Fibonnaci Sequence with both an _iterative_ and _recursive_ solution.

## Merge Sort

This file demonstrates a _recursive_ implementation of a sorting algorithm known as _Merge Sort_. This algorithm is especially useful over other sorting algorithms, such as bubble sort, because it has a time complexity of _n log(n)_
